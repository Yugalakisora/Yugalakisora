        "This exercise will test several skills that will be important throughout your Python career: loops, user input, converting types, and comparing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "More specifically, programs all have to get input to do something interesting, and that input often comes from the user. Knowing how to ask the user for input is not only useful, but allows us to think about the type of data we're getting, how to convert it into a format we can use, and what the format would be.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you might know, Python only provides two kinds of loops: `for` and `while`. Knowing how to write and use them will serve you well throughout your Python career. The fact that nearly every type of data knows how to work inside a `for` loop makes such loops common and useful. If you're working with database records, elements in a file, or the results from searching for text using regular expressions, you'll be using `for` loops quite a bit.\n",

        "For this exercise:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Write a function (`guessing_game`) that takes no arguments.\n",
        "- When run, the function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).\n",
        "- Then, ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.\n",
        "- Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of the following:\n",
        "  - Too high\n",
        "  - Too low\n",
        "  - Just right\n",
        "- If the user guesses correctly, the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.\n",
        "- The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll also be prompting the user to enter text with the `input` function. The function takes a single string as an argument, which is displayed to the user. The function then returns the string containing whatever the user entered; for example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def print_double_input():\n",
        "    \"\"\"This function asks for an input, multiplies it by 2 and prints it.\"\"\"\n",
        "    user_value = int(input('Enter a number: '))\n",
        "    print(f'Double of your input is {user_value * 2}!')\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "NOTE If the user presses Enter when presented with the input prompt, the value returned by `input` is an empty string, not `None`. Indeed, the return value from `input` will always be a string, regardless of what the user entered.\n",
